# Black Swan Crisis Operating System — Phase 1

Phase 1 of the BSCOS: the shared shell and state-machine foundation. It builds
the top-level XState machine, the First Check (danger gate + capacity read), a
text-only Survival Mode placeholder, a global Safety Override, and append-only,
local-first session history.

This phase **only** builds the foundation. There is no 3D, no Black Swan
cockpit / seven-stage Strategy Mode, no Crisis Operating Record panel, no Door
Audit, and no AI-generated text. See `BSCOS_unified_build_plan2.md` (the source
of truth) for the full architecture and later phases.

## Stack

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- XState v5 (top-level state machine)
- Local-first persistence: IndexedDB when available, with a localStorage
  fallback (used in test/jsdom environments). Offline-first, no backend, no auth.
- Vitest for tests

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # start the dev server
npm run build      # type-check + production build
npm test           # run the Vitest suite
```

> A fresh Session is created on first launch and persisted locally. Clearing the
> site's storage (IndexedDB / localStorage) starts a new Session.

## How it works

```
boot ──(always)──> firstCheck ──> survival
                        │
  SAFETY_TRIGGER (root handler, from ANY state) ──> safetyOverride  (terminal)
```

- **boot** loads or creates the local `User` + `Session`, writes a snapshot, and
  routes on. A persisted safety session resumes straight into `safetyOverride`,
  so a terminated session can never be re-entered after reload.
- **firstCheck** runs the danger gate first. Selecting any of the five danger
  conditions records a `SafetyEvent` and routes immediately to the Safety
  Override. "None of these" continues to the single capacity question; the
  chosen answer is mapped to a `CapacityBand` and stored on the session.
- **survival** shows one fixed templated move and a confirm button. Confirming
  writes a `move_logged` event and a snapshot, and stays in Survival.
- **safetyOverride** is a `final` state — terminal for the session. It suppresses
  the tool flow, shows help resources, and offers no path back into any tool.

Routing precedence (`safety > capacity > requested mode`) lives in
`src/machine/guards.ts` (`resolveRoute`). In Phase 1 every danger-free band
collapses to Survival; the precedence is real today so later phases drop in.

### Append-only history

The three logs — `history`, `events`, `safetyEvents` — are append-only. The
only mutation surface is the `append*` helpers in `src/state/session.ts`; there
is no update or delete path anywhere. A snapshot is written on entry to every
atomic state (the compound `firstCheck` delegates to its atomic children, so
each occupied state contributes exactly one snapshot).

## Phase 2 — Survival sub-states (Engine 1 only)

Survival Mode is now a compound state with the Engine 1 movement sub-states.
The Black Swan Engine remains stubbed; nothing past Phase 2 is built.

```
survival
  router ──(zero capacity)──> zcfm ; otherwise ──> normal
  normal   ──CONFIRM_MOVE ×2──> recovery ; ──REPORT_NEAR_ZERO──> zcfm
  zcfm     ──CONFIRM_MOVE ×2──> recovery ; ──CANNOT_MOVE──> immobile
  immobile ──WATCH_FOR_WINDOW──> windowDetection      (non-terminal; never No-Exit)
  windowDetection ──more capacity──> normal ; ──external change──> zcfm ; ──not yet──> stay
  recovery ──CONFIRM_MOVE──> stay ; ──TOO_MUCH──> normal   (does NOT unlock Guided Mode)
```

- **Two-moves rule:** each completed move increments `recoveryScore.successfulMovesInARow`;
  a capacity drop or "too much" resets it. Two in a row routes to Recovery.
- **ZCFM** shows one ultra-small move (no money / planning / sustained attention / new
  skill / external approval / outcome dependency). Success = attempted or completed.
- **Immobile Constraint** is a non-terminal capacity state — the door still works and
  waiting counts as the move. It is **not** No-Exit and **not** the Safety Override.
- **Window Detection** is low-pressure: fixed options, no timers, no countdown.
- SafetyOverride stays global, terminal, and reachable from every sub-state; one immutable
  snapshot is still appended on entry to every atomic state.

New content: `content/{zcfmMoves,immobileCopy,windowOptions,recoveryCopy}.ts`.
New screens: `ZCFMScreen`, `ImmobileScreen`, `WindowDetectionScreen`, `RecoveryScreen`.

## Diagnostics layer (Phase 2B — pure, unwired)

Engine 1 has an early Trap-Architecture diagnostic layer. It is **pure library
code that is not part of the running app** — it is never imported by the state
machine, UI, routing, or persistence, so it adds **zero runtime behaviour** (the
app bundle is unchanged). It exists only to be exercised by tests for now.

- **Phase 2B-0 — type foundation** (`src/state/diagnostics.ts`): the five core
  `TrapDiagnosticState`s, ten `IntermediateVerdict`s, the eight `DoorType`s
  (aligned with `DoorRecord`), and the result/record interfaces. Types only.
- **Phase 2B-1 — proxy classifier** (`src/diagnostics/detectTrapDiagnostic.ts`):
  `detectTrapDiagnostic(input, now?)` maps proxy signals to a
  `TrapDiagnosticResult`. It is **pure and deterministic** (inject `now` for a
  fixed timestamp), never auto-confirms No-Exit (capped at evidence-bounded
  `PROVISIONAL`, blocked by open questions), needs trajectory for Backfiring,
  and never overrides the SafetyOverride or movement-state regression.
- **Phase 2B-2 — validation suite** (`diagnosticScenarios.fixtures.ts` +
  `detectTrapDiagnostic.scenarios.test.ts`): realistic scenario fixtures that
  prove the five states diverge cleanly and the safety ceilings hold.
- **Phase 2B-3 — MODEL_MISMATCH calibration**: MODEL_MISMATCH does not become a
  primary diagnostic state from a single weak signal. A single weak signal
  produces only a provisional model-fit concern and does not count toward
  SYSTEM_OVERLOAD simultaneity. Two or more signals, or one explicit
  contradiction, are required for MODEL_MISMATCH to become a fired core
  diagnostic state.
- **Phase 2B-4 — Door Audit Lite foundation** (`src/diagnostics/doorAuditLite.ts`):
  pure diagnostic infrastructure only. It extends the existing
  `DoorAuditLiteRecord` scaffold and adds `summarizeDoorAuditLite(records,
  options?)`, which records and summarizes door evidence as an **evidence
  ledger, not a decision engine**. It uses the same No-Exit blocker categories
  as the classifier — refused, delayed, capacity-blocked, unsearched,
  predicted-sealed, low witness reliability, and incomplete enumeration — and
  treats an omitted `enumerationComplete` as **incomplete**, so it blocks any
  premature No-Exit interpretation when mapping is incomplete or uncertain. It
  never imports or calls the classifier, is not wired into the app, has no UI,
  no `selectTarget`, and makes no recommendations or AI/model calls.
- **Phase 2B-5 — reconciliation tests**: proves Door Audit Lite blocker flags and
  classifier No-Exit blockers stay aligned. This remains test-only / pure
  diagnostic validation and adds no runtime wiring. No shared blocker-category
  constant is introduced, so the tests can detect drift between the two
  independently implemented layers.
- **Phase 2B-6 — diagnostic readout copy contract**
  (`src/diagnostics/diagnosticReadoutCopy.ts`): a **static** safety contract for
  how diagnostic findings MAY eventually be displayed — the approved labels,
  descriptions, required qualifiers, allowed frames, and the banned-phrase list —
  exposed by the single no-argument API `getDiagnosticCopyContract()`. It is
  **not a formatter**: it never takes a live `TrapDiagnosticResult` and never
  assembles display text from classifier output. Every rule carries
  `displayPermissionGranted: false` and `mustNotRecommend: true`, so defining
  safe language for a state grants **no** permission to surface it (that is a
  later phase with its own gate). No-Exit copy stays evidence-bounded ("a
  statement about the file, not about the world"), and Backfiring copy is
  pattern-only — it routes any next step to a qualified person and is never a
  treatment instruction. Pure, deterministic, deep-frozen, and unwired.

**Not built yet:** no full Door Audit, no Door Audit UI, no `selectTarget`, no
diagnostic routing/persistence, and no Guided Mode, Strategy Mode, COR panel,
3D, or Observatory.

## Phase 3-0 — Guided Recovery Boundary Scaffold

Phase 3-0 defines the **boundary** for a future Guided Recovery — what it is
allowed to do before it does anything — as pure scaffolding
(`src/recovery/guidedRecoveryBoundary.ts`). It is **not** Guided Recovery, not a
UI, and not wired into the running app; like the diagnostics layer it is pure
library code exercised only by tests.

- Guided Recovery is for **stabilizing capacity after Survival Recovery**. The
  core rule: **Phase 3 restores capacity; Phase 4 chooses strategy.**
- `evaluateGuidedRecoveryBoundary(input)` returns **permission only**, never a
  recovery action. It uses strict precedence — **SafetyOverride → survival state
  → capacity band → user intent** — and **SafetyOverride always wins**: when it
  is active the decision is `blocked_by_safety_override` regardless of every
  other field. Entry is allowed only from the stable Survival `recovery` footing
  (two steady moves in a row), with `recovering`/`stable` capacity and an
  explicit `stabilize`/`unknown` intent. `high` capacity is **blocked** here
  (reserved for a later Strategy phase), never routed into strategy. Missing gate
  inputs fail safe and block: an absent `capacityBand` or `successfulMovesInARow`
  blocks, and an absent `userIntent` is `blocked_by_missing_intent` — distinct
  from the explicit typed value `unknown`, which may pass.
- Every decision carries the constant guarantees `mustNotDiagnose`,
  `mustNotRecommend`, `mustNotSelectStrategy`, `mustNotGiveTreatmentInstruction`,
  and `mustNotActAsTherapy` as `true` — even when entry is allowed.
- Guided Recovery copy is **static framing only**, not a micro-step catalog:
  there is no recovery-step library, no generated or personalized instructions,
  no recommendations. The copy contract and every rule carry
  `displayPermissionGranted: false` and `mustNotRecommend: true`, so defining
  safe language grants **no** permission to surface Guided Recovery — that is a
  later, gated phase.
- Guided Recovery does not diagnose, select strategy, recommend actions, provide
  therapy, or give medical/treatment instructions. SafetyOverride remains
  supreme, and Phase 3 stays separate from Phase 4 Strategy Mode. No Guided
  Recovery UI or runtime wiring exists yet.

## Phase 3-1 — Guided Recovery Type / State Foundation

Phase 3-1 defines the **state shape** for a future Guided Recovery
(`src/recovery/guidedRecoveryState.ts`) — stage/status unions, boundary + permission
flags, session slots, and abstract stage metadata — **before** any UI, runtime
wiring, or recovery steps exist. It is type/state foundation only: it adds no
Guided Recovery UI, no runtime wiring, no recovery step library, no
recommendations, and no strategy selection.

- `GuidedRecoveryStage` (`not_started`/`orientation`/`capacity_check`/
  `stabilization`/`reflection`/`handoff`/`closed`) and `GuidedRecoveryStatus`
  (`inactive`/`available`/`active`/`paused`/`blocked_by_safety_override`/`closed`)
  are closed label unions. `active`/`paused` are **reserved** future values —
  Phase 3-1 adds no `createActive`/`createPaused` or any transition helper.
- The factory is **allowed-only**: `createAvailableGuidedRecoveryState(input)`
  returns an `available` state **only** when `entryStatus === 'allowed'`; every
  blocked entry status yields a blocked state that preserves the `entryStatus`
  (SafetyOverride → `blocked_by_safety_override`, otherwise `inactive`) — never
  `available`/`active`. It stores a caller-supplied `entryStatus` and **does not**
  evaluate entry policy (it never calls `evaluateGuidedRecoveryBoundary`).
- Every state keeps boundary flags literal `true` (`mustNotDiagnose`,
  `mustNotRecommend`, `mustNotSelectStrategy`, `mustNotGiveTreatmentInstruction`,
  `mustNotActAsTherapy`, `mustStayEvidenceBounded`, `mustRemainCapacityFocused`)
  and permission flags `displayPermissionGranted: false` /
  `runtimePermissionGranted: false` — even under SafetyOverride. Defining the
  shape grants **no** permission to display, run, route, persist, or enter Guided
  Recovery.
- Stage definitions are **labels only** and authorize no recovery prompts,
  reflection questions, journaling prompts, exercises, coping techniques,
  concrete steps, treatment guidance, strategy, recommendations, or user-facing
  dialogue. There is **no** `notes` (or other free-form text) slot, and no
  strategy/target/action/recommendation/plan/route/COR field.
- Any timestamp fields are **caller-supplied strings only** (the module never
  calls a clock), and `copyContractVersion` is a caller-supplied string that adds
  no versioning behavior to `getGuidedRecoveryCopyContract`. The module imports
  only the `GuidedRecoveryEntryStatus` **type** from the boundary (erased at
  build); it stays pure and unwired, so the app bundle is unchanged.

## Phase 3-2 — Guided Recovery Copy Contract

Phase 3-2 defines **static copy rules** for a future Guided Recovery — what its
copy is allowed to sound like — in a pure module
(`src/recovery/guidedRecoveryCopy.ts`), before any UI, runtime wiring, recovery
steps, prompts, or user-facing flow exists. Copy contract only.

- It adds exactly one getter, `getGuidedRecoveryStageCopyContract()`, returning a
  deep-frozen `GuidedRecoveryStageCopyContract` (version, `approvedFrameExamples`,
  `stageRules`, `requiredQualifiers`, `bannedPhrases`, `forbiddenBehaviors`). It
  **does not** alter, rename, move, or call the Phase 3-0
  `getGuidedRecoveryCopyContract()` in `guidedRecoveryBoundary.ts`, which stays
  untouched.
- It adds **no** Guided Recovery UI, no runtime wiring, no recovery step library,
  no reflection prompts, no journaling prompts, no exercises, no coping
  techniques, and no user-facing dialogue flow.
- It grants **no** display permission and **no** runtime permission:
  `displayPermissionGranted` and `runtimePermissionGranted` are `false` (and
  `mustNotRecommend` is `true`) on the contract, every `approvedFrameExamples`
  entry, and every stage rule. `approvedFrameExamples[].text` is **static
  contract metadata only — not display-ready copy and never rendered directly.**
- Frame examples are categorised (`orientation`, `capacity`, `safety_boundary`,
  `uncertainty`, `mode_separation`, `handoff`, `closure`). Stage rules cover the
  Phase 3-1 stage labels as **constraints, not content**.
- It remains **subordinate to SafetyOverride** (copy preserves "SafetyOverride
  remains higher priority" / "if safety is active, Guided Recovery is
  unavailable", and never softens or bypasses it) and **separate from Phase 4
  Strategy Mode** (no strategy/target/route/action selection, recommendation, or
  diagnostic-to-action language). **Reflection** is extra-fenced (no reflection
  questions, journaling prompts, "how do you feel" framing, trauma/emotional
  processing, or clinical framing), **handoff** must not recommend/route or point
  toward a later mode, and **closure** must not imply resolution, success,
  healing, readiness, safety, completion, or stability.
- The module is pure and unwired: it imports only the `GuidedRecoveryStage`
  **type** from the state module (erased at build), calls no factory/evaluator/
  diagnostic getter, and is tree-shaken out — the app bundle is unchanged.

## Phase 3-3 — Recovery Micro-Step Candidate Catalog

Phase 3-3 defines a **static candidate catalog** for future Guided Recovery
(`src/recovery/guidedRecoveryMicroSteps.ts`). Candidates are **inert
placeholders** that exist only to exercise the catalog shape, constraints, and
safety tests — they are **not** approved user-facing recovery content. A later
content/display/selection phase must review candidates again before any user
exposure.

- It adds one getter, `getGuidedRecoveryMicroStepCatalog()`, returning a
  deep-frozen `GuidedRecoveryMicroStepCatalog` (version, `candidates`,
  `bannedPhrases`, `forbiddenBehaviors`). It does **not** display, select, rank,
  recommend, personalize, adapt, generate, execute, route, or persist
  candidates, and adds no `getNextRecoveryStep`/`selectRecoveryStep`/
  `rankRecoverySteps`/etc.
- It grants **no** permission: `displayPermissionGranted`,
  `runtimePermissionGranted`, `selectionPermissionGranted`,
  `recommendationPermissionGranted`, and `persistencePermissionGranted` are all
  `false` (and `mustNotRecommend` is `true`) on the catalog and **every**
  candidate. Each candidate also carries stop-safe flags (`mustBeOptional`,
  `mustBeSkippable`, `mustBeStopSafe`, `mustNotRequirePhysicalExertion`,
  `mustNotRequireMemoryRecall`, `mustNotRequireWriting`, …) all `true`.
- **Candidate labels and purposes are structural metadata only — not
  display-ready copy, not instructions, not activities, and never rendered
  directly.** Each label names an inert stage slot (`"orientation slot marker"`,
  `"capacity slot marker"`, `"stabilization slot marker"`, `"review slot
  marker"`, `"handoff slot marker"`, `"closure slot marker"`); each purpose is a
  fixed structural template (`"Defines an inert <category> placeholder in the
  catalog; grants no display, selection, recommendation, persistence, or runtime
  permission."`). No candidate describes what a user does, feels, notices,
  remembers, changes, tries, practices, or completes.
- Candidates use **`compatibleStages`** (non-exclusive compatibility metadata —
  no ordering, routing, selection, or display), not a single-stage route. There
  are no concrete recovery actions, reflection/journaling prompts, exercises, or
  coping techniques; reflection/handoff/closure-compatible candidates are extra
  fenced. SafetyOverride priority is preserved (`bypassing SafetyOverride` is a
  forbidden behavior) and Phase 3 stays separate from Phase 4 Strategy Mode.
- The module is pure and unwired: it imports only the `GuidedRecoveryStage`
  **type** from the state module (erased at build), calls no factory/evaluator/
  copy/diagnostic getter, and is tree-shaken out — the app bundle is unchanged.

## Phase 3-4 — Guided Recovery UI Shell

Phase 3-4 defines an **inert UI shell boundary** for a future Guided Recovery
(`src/recovery/GuidedRecoveryShell.tsx`). It is a non-functional preview only —
deliberately kept **out of `src/components/`** (the live component tree) and
imported **only by tests**, so it is never routed, rendered, entered, or bundled
into runtime.

- It adds **no** runtime Guided Recovery behavior, **no** route, **no**
  navigation item, **no** appMachine state/transition, and **no** persistence or
  session field. It does not render in the live app and does not appear in the
  runtime JS bundle (the app bundle stays byte-identical).
- `GuidedRecoveryShell()` is a **static, non-interactive** component with **no
  props/inputs**, an `aria-hidden="true"` root, and **no** buttons, links, forms,
  inputs, event/keyboard handlers, `href`, `role="button"`, or `tabIndex`. It
  renders **only** these approved non-operational placeholder strings and nothing
  else: *"Guided Recovery shell placeholder." / "No Guided Recovery runtime is
  enabled." / "No recovery steps are displayed in this shell." / "This shell
  grants no display, selection, recommendation, persistence, or runtime
  permission." / "SafetyOverride remains higher priority."*
- It grants **no** display/runtime/selection/recommendation/persistence
  permission and implies no permission to use Guided Recovery. It renders **no**
  micro-step candidate, **no** copy-contract frame example, and **no** step,
  prompt, instruction, or recommendation; it imports/calls **none** of the
  Phase 3-0…3-3 getters/evaluator/factories.
- It stays **subordinate to SafetyOverride** (no softening/bypass language) and
  **separate from Phase 4 Strategy Mode** (no strategy/target/route/action or
  recommendation language). The shell has **zero non-test importers** and is not
  exported through any barrel file.

### Capacity bands — the `high` gap

`CapacityBand` includes `high`, but First Check has no answer that maps to it
(answers A–D map to `zero`/`low`/`recovering`/`stable`). `high` is **reserved**
for a future High-Capacity Strategy / 3D Observatory unlock and is intentionally
unreachable from the current flow until those modes ship. See the roadmap note
on `bandForAnswer` in `src/machine/guards.ts`.
